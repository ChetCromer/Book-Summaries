# Book Summaries and Notes

These are summaries and personal notes from books I've purchased and read and/or listened to.

Many of the summaries, outlines, and quotes for these books are generated by ChatGPT, and I'm still a bit unsure of how I feel about letting it "get better" by writing summaries of books without knowing for sure that I own them. These summaries are likely not provided by the author, but is rather regurgitated content from their creative work without their specific permission. That's why I think I'll commit to only using this for books I actually own.
