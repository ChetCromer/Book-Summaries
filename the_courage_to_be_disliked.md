# The Courage to be Disliked

**Summary of *The Courage to Be Disliked* by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga (500 words)**

*The Courage to Be Disliked* by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga is a philosophical self-help book based on the principles of Alfred Adler’s psychology, particularly focused on the idea of personal freedom and self-empowerment. The book is structured as a dialogue between a philosopher and a young man, where the philosopher challenges common assumptions about happiness, relationships, and how to live a fulfilling life.

The central message of the book is that people are not determined by their past, traumas, or circumstances. Instead, we are in control of our own lives and can choose how we interpret and respond to our experiences. The philosopher argues that much of human suffering is self-imposed, often stemming from a desire for approval or the need to meet others' expectations. To live a fulfilled life, one must develop the “courage to be disliked,” meaning the ability to live according to one’s own values without being swayed by others’ opinions or judgments.

A key tenet of Adlerian psychology, as presented in the book, is that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. Most people live their lives in fear of being rejected or disliked, and they mold their actions to fit into societal expectations, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. The philosopher emphasizes that life is much freer and more fulfilling when one lets go of the need for external validation.

The book introduces several concepts to explain how individuals can break free from these psychological traps. One of these is the idea of “separation of tasks,” which involves recognizing that everyone is responsible for their own life and happiness. By separating what is your task from what belongs to others, you can avoid unnecessary conflict and emotional burden. You do not need to change how others perceive you or take on the burden of their expectations.

Another core idea is that the purpose of human behavior is not determined by past events (as in Freud’s psychoanalysis) but by future goals. According to the philosopher, individuals create goals, consciously or unconsciously, to justify their current actions. By understanding this, one can make intentional choices to shape their own future, rather than feeling trapped by their past.

In addition to the courage to be disliked, the book advocates for the courage to be ordinary. Many people feel pressure to be special or superior, but Adler’s philosophy emphasizes the importance of embracing our ordinary, authentic selves. True happiness comes from contributing to the community and living in harmony with others, rather than constantly striving for status or superiority.

Overall, *The Courage to Be Disliked* challenges conventional ideas about happiness and success, advocating for a life lived with authenticity, freedom, and a commitment to interpersonal harmony.
