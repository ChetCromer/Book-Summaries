*The Courage to Be Happy* by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga is a sequel to their bestseller *The Courage to Be Disliked*. Like the first book, it presents a dialogue between a philosopher and a young man, exploring the ideas of Alfred Adler's psychological philosophy. While *The Courage to Be Disliked* focused on letting go of others’ judgments and embracing freedom, this book delves deeper into the pursuit of happiness, emphasizing that happiness is a choice and requires courage.

The central message of the book is that happiness does not come from external circumstances or achievements but from choosing to live a life based on personal values and contributing to others. The philosopher argues that happiness is attainable for everyone, but many people avoid it because it requires taking responsibility for their own lives and facing challenges head-on. True happiness is not found in the pursuit of pleasure or success but in finding meaning through relationships and community.

A core concept in the book is the idea that happiness is inseparable from contribution. The philosopher explains that a fulfilling life is rooted in social interest—Adler’s term for a sense of belonging and the desire to contribute to the welfare of others. When individuals focus on serving others, they gain a sense of purpose that leads to lasting happiness. This contrasts with the young man’s initial belief that happiness is about individual achievement or approval from others.

Another important theme is the distinction between living for praise and living for purpose. The philosopher emphasizes that when people rely on external validation, they place their happiness in the hands of others, which makes them vulnerable to disappointment and insecurity. In contrast, living according to one’s values and focusing on what one can contribute leads to a more stable and genuine form of happiness. This requires the courage to live without needing the approval of others, a theme that ties back to *The Courage to Be Disliked*.

The philosopher also discusses how people often create "life lies" to avoid taking responsibility for their own unhappiness. These life lies are excuses or beliefs that prevent them from facing their own fears or shortcomings. One example is the belief that happiness is something that happens to us rather than something we create. Overcoming these lies requires recognizing that we are in control of our lives and can choose happiness at any moment, regardless of our circumstances.

The book concludes by reinforcing the idea that happiness is a courageous choice. It involves embracing vulnerability, letting go of the need for control, and finding meaning in relationships. Happiness, according to Adlerian psychology, is not an end goal but a byproduct of living a life of purpose, contribution, and genuine connection with others.
